# QMPT Lab IDE Roadmap

## Roadmap

- **v0.4.x**  
  Modular UI (docs, notes, runs, plots), classical toy pipeline, run registry, quantum stub.

- **v0.5.0**  
  QMPT core integration (patterns/layers/metrics); scenario-based classical runs; quantum stub config; layer/pattern inspector; sample configs and tests.

- **v0.6.0 (current, “Quantum Bridge”)**  
  Local quantum simulator backend (qiskit-based) with encodings and scenarios; unified run outputs for classical/quantum; UI backend selector; updated configs/tests/docs.

- **v0.7.0 (Hybrid loop)**  
  Classical–quantum coupling: layer stress drives circuit params; quantum observables feed back into layer updates; localization (EN/RU) groundwork; richer visualization.

- **v0.8.0 (Remote / pluggable backends)**  
  Optional remote/hardware backends with guarded credentials; backend plugin interface; expanded QMPT-inspired quantum scenarios.

- **v1.0**  
  Stable IDE ↔ backend API, documented workflows from theory to experiment, improved error handling/tests, packaging.
