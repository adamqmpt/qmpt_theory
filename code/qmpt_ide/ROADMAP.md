# QMPT Lab IDE Roadmap

## Roadmap

- **v0.4.x**  
  Modular UI (docs, notes, runs, plots), classical toy pipeline, run registry, quantum stub.

- **v0.5.0**  
  QMPT core integration (patterns/layers/metrics); scenario-based classical runs; quantum stub config; layer/pattern inspector; sample configs and tests.

- **v0.6.0 (“Quantum Bridge”)**  
  Local quantum simulator backend (qiskit-based) with encodings and scenarios; unified run outputs for classical/quantum; UI backend selector; updated configs/tests/docs.

- **v0.7.0 (“Ensembles & Anomaly Tracking”)**  
  Ensemble runs with dataset manifests and aggregate metrics; anomaly/stress run metrics; hybrid classical–quantum probe pipeline; CLI runner; basic UI hooks.

- **v0.8.0**  
  Calibration-aware metrics, new classical scenarios (anomaly injection, collapse/recovery, transfer cycle), templates, schema versioning.

- **v0.9.0 (current, “Quantum Patterns & Examples”)**  
  Quantum example scenarios (entangled anomaly, transfer chain, measurement collapse); quantum metrics; derived expression layer; quantum example browser and plotting improvements; packaging skeleton.

- **v1.0**  
  Stable IDE ↔ backend API, documented workflows from theory to experiment, improved error handling/tests, packaging, external data integration.
