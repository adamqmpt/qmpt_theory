  Integrate QMPT core (patterns/layers/metrics); scenario-based classical runs; quantum stub config shape; layer/pattern inspector; sample configs and tests.

- **v0.6.x**  
  Real quantum backend (Qiskit/Cirq or similar), richer scenarios, presets for classical vs quantum comparison, basic backend telemetry.

- **v0.7.x**
