# lab/ — QMPT research & experiments

This folder stores human/AI research notes, roadmaps, and experimental designs.
All executable code lives under `code/`; lab files are Markdown-only.

Current contents:

- `AGI_QMPT_PRINCIPLES_en.md` / `_ru.md` — AGI design principles from QMPT view.
- `AGI_QMPT_QUANTUM_BOOTSTRAP_en.md` / `_ru.md` — roadmap for QMPT-aware AGI with quantum resources.
- `notes/` — IDE-generated or manual notes.
- `logs/` — placeholders for experiment logs (no code).
